<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>I'm Kehinde Ajayi but prefer Kenny</h2>
<h3>A Data Scientist and a PhD student at the Old Dominion University</h3>

<h2><b>About me</b></h2>
<p>I am an adept Data Scientist who uses data science and analytics to drive business growth.
I discovered the field of data science after my undergraduate degree in 
Mathematics from a prestigious university in Nigeria. I was more interested
in the application of the theorectical knowledge gained at the university.
So, I worked with a consulting firm where I was exposed to using data and 
using machine learning tools to solve client's problem.
After my Master's degree in Statistics at the Montana State University, USA
I did a research fellowship with the Applied Machine Learning group at the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory where I worked on a project to combine 
machine learning with human-derived knowledge to analyze text data.
